The Shopping cart is my personal project which is built using React JS. I have developed this project to implement some of the react concepts to gets hands on.
# React Application

## Overview
This is a React application that serves as a basic e-commerce platform. It allows users to browse products, add them to their cart, and view their cart contents. Additionally, it provides an admin dashboard for managing users and products.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd project-directory
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage
To start the development server and run the application, use the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Dependencies
- React
- React Router

## React Concepts Used
- **Functional Components**: All components in this project are functional components, utilizing React hooks for managing state and side effects.
  
- **React Router**: Used for declarative routing within the application, enabling navigation between different pages/components without a full page reload.

- **State Management**: State is managed using the `useState` hook from React, allowing components to maintain and update their own state.

- **Context API**: The application uses the Context API for managing global state related to products, allowing components to access and update this state without prop drilling.

- **Lifecycle Methods**: The `useEffect` hook is used for managing side effects, such as fetching data from an API or setting up subscriptions. 

- **Conditional Rendering**: Conditional rendering is used to display different components or UI elements based on certain conditions, such as whether a user is logged in or if data is still loading.
